# WhatsApp Session Persistence

This application now supports automatic WhatsApp session persistence, ensuring that your WhatsApp connections remain active even after server restarts.

## How It Works

### Automatic Session Restoration
- When the server starts, it automatically scans for stored session data in the `.wwebjs_auth` directory
- All previously authenticated WhatsApp sessions are automatically restored
- Sessions are restored in parallel for faster startup times
- Each session uses `LocalAuth` with a unique `clientId` for proper isolation

### Session Storage
- Sessions are stored in `.wwebjs_auth/session-{senderId}/` directories
- Each session contains authentication data, cookies, and browser state
- Sessions persist across server restarts automatically

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Enable/disable automatic session restoration (default: true)
AUTO_RESTORE_SESSIONS=true
```

### Disable Auto-Restoration
To disable automatic session restoration on startup:
```env
AUTO_RESTORE_SESSIONS=false
```

## API Endpoints

### Manual Session Restoration
```http
POST /api/whatsapp/sessions/restore
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Session restoration initiated successfully",
  "note": "Sessions are being restored in the background. Check individual session statuses for progress."
}
```

### Check Session Status
```http
GET /api/whatsapp/session/{senderId}/status
```

### Check All Sessions Status
```http
GET /api/whatsapp/sessions/status
```

## Benefits

1. **No Re-authentication Required**: Users don't need to scan QR codes again after server restarts
2. **Faster Startup**: Sessions restore automatically without manual intervention
3. **Production Ready**: Handles multiple sessions efficiently
4. **Configurable**: Can be enabled/disabled via environment variables
5. **Error Handling**: Failed session restorations don't affect other sessions

## Logs

The application provides detailed logging for session management:

```
ðŸ”„ Found 2 stored session(s), restoring...
ðŸ”„ Restoring session for user123 from storage...
ðŸ”„ Restoring session for admin from storage...
âœ… WhatsApp session user123 restored and ready!
âœ… WhatsApp session admin restored and ready!
```

## Important Notes

- Sessions are stored locally in the `.wwebjs_auth` directory
- Make sure to backup this directory if you need to preserve sessions
- Sessions may expire if not used for extended periods (WhatsApp's policy)
- The application runs in test mode when `NODE_ENV=test` or `WHATSAPP_TEST_MODE=true`
